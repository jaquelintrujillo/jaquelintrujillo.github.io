            <h3> Asthma Importance </h3>
              <p> Asthma is a disease that has a high prevalence, today. The U.S.
                population spends billions of dollars each year for medicine and
                treatment. Different types of treatment include an inhaler,
                steroids, and an anti-inflammatory. The cost of medicine can go
                up to $100, even higher in more serious cases. Asthma is, also,
                much more common in communities of low income people of color.
                This is because the areas they live in have poor housing qualities
                that trigger asthma, especially in children. Black children are
                proven to be twice as much more likely to have asthma than white
                children. Education seems to impact the probability of asthma.
                Those who didn’t finish high school have a higher probability of
                having asthma than those who have a finished education. Asthma
                is caused by environmental factors more than genetics. When an
                environmental crisis occurs, it causes people's symptoms to worsen.
                In extreme cases familes might have to move, if the environment
                is too hazardous. Since asthma is common, the total amount of
                money spent for medicine and treatment goes up to $56 billion per
                year. Asthma continues to increase, making the cost increase as
                well. Over the past decade people have a 15% more likely chance
                to have asthma. This both effects the school and work environment.
                In 2009, 10.5 million children in the U.S. missed school that year.
                Concerning work, 14.2 adults didn’t come in due to asthma. The
                struggle is there isn’t a way to cure asthma, only medication to
                help reduce the symptoms. As asthma keeps becoming more frequent,
                the problem continues to increase.

            <h3> Wildfire Importance </h3>
                <p> The California wildfires have been very significant throughout
                  the last few years. About 90% of the wildfires have been caused by
                  humans.These fires destroyed a new state record of 459,123 acres
                  burned last July during the Mendocino Complex Fire. The Mendocino
                  Complex Fire was the largest fire in California history which took
                  4 months to put out. Not only are thousands of acres being burned
                  but also many lives are being lost. During the Camp Fire in Butte
                  County, California, there were 88 lives lost along with the
                  thousands of acres burned. Also, during the Woolsey Fire in Malibu,
                  58 people were killed. Due to the amount of money being used to
                  repair utilities after the fires, the State Senate passed a bill
                  with a multibillion-dollar utility fund to pay for the distruction.
                  These fires have impacted California and it’s residents in multiple
                  ways and continue to be a rising problem.
