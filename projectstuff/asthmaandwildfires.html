    <h4> Importance </h4>
    <p> Asthma is a disease that has a high prevalence these days. The U.S.
      population spends billions of dollars each year for medicine and treatment.
      Different types of treatment include an inhaler, steroids, and an
      anti-inflammatory. The cost of medicine can go up to $100, even higher in
      more serious cases. Asthma is also much more common in colored populations
      and lower income communities. This is because these areas have poor housing
      qualities that trigger asthma, especially in children. Black children are
      proven to be twice as much more likely to have asthma than white children.
      Even educations seems to impact the probability of asthma. Those who didn’t
      finish high school have a higher probability of having asthma than those
      who have a finished education. Adults that have an income of less than
      Asthma also caused more by environmental factors than genetics. When an
      environmental crisis does occur, it causes people with asthma have more
      extreme symptoms. If the hazard is too dangerous, those families may even
      have to move. Since asthma is extremely common, the total amount of money
      spent for medicine and treatment goes up to $56 billion per year. Asthma
      continues to increase, making the cost increase as well. Over the past
      decade people have a 15% more likely chance to have asthma. This both
      effects the school and work environment. In 2009 10.5 million children
      in the U.S. missed school that year. Concerning work, 14.2 adults didn’t
      come in due to asthma. The struggle is there isn’t a way to cure asthma,
      only medication to help reduce the symptoms. As asthma keeps becoming more
      frequent, the U.S’’s problem will only increase more.

              Opens up lungs for easier breathing.
              <br>
              Steroids:
              <br>
              This modifies hormones to reduce the inflammation.
              <br>
              Anti-inflammatory:

              This prevents swelling in tissue.
              <br>

            This is an effective way to deliver asthma medications to infants,
            small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma
            inhaler. It is also used when someone needs a big dose of inhaled
            medication. Some people need this form of medication during the wild
            fires. Nebulized therapy is, also, called a "breathing treatment."
