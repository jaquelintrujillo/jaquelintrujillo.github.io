    <h4> Importance </h4>
    <p> We must find ways of reducing this problem. Asthma is a disease that has a
      high prevalence these days. The U.S. population spends billions of dollars
      each year for medicine and treatment. Different types of treatment include
      an inhaler, steroids, and an anti-inflammatory. The cost of medicine can go
      up to $100, even higher in more serious cases. Asthma is also much more
      common in colored populations and lower income communities. This is because
      these areas have poor housing qualities that trigger asthma, especially in
      children. Asthma also seems to be caused more by environmental factors than
      genetics. When an environmental crisis does occur, it causes people with
      asthma have more extreme symptoms. If the hazard is too dangerous, those
      families may even have to move.

            <h4> TREATMENT </h4>
              <p> Bronchodilator/inhaler:
                <br>
            Opens up lungs for easier breathing.
              <br>
            Steroids:
              <br>
            This modifies hormones to reduce the inflammation.
              <br>
            Anti-inflammatory:
              <br>
            This prevents swelling in tissue.
              <br>
            Nebulizers:
            <br>
            This is an effective way to deliver asthma medications to infants,
            small children and to anyone who has difficulty using an asthma
            inhaler. It is also used when someone needs a big dose of inhaled
            medication. Some people need this form of medication during the wild
             fires. Nebulized therapy is, also, called a "breathing treatment."
